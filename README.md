🌺 Flower Classification using CNN
📌 Project Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras to classify different flower species. It leverages transfer learning and bottleneck features to improve model accuracy.

🔥 Features
Uses ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation
Employs a pretrained model for feature extraction
Custom fully connected layers for classification
Evaluation using confusion matrix and accuracy metrics
Visualizes training progress
📁 Dataset
The dataset includes multiple flower species images.
Images are resized to 224x224 for compatibility with CNN architectures.
Data is split into training, validation, and test sets.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
NumPy & Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/zaidihm/flower-classification-cnn.git  
cd flower-classification-cnn 
2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt  
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook flower_classification_cnn.ipynb  

🔮 Future Improvements
Fine-tuning the pretrained model (e.g., ResNet, VGG16)
Deploying as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
Adding more classes for better generalization
